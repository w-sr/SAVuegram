# Vuegram

> A simple social media web app built with Vue.js and Firebase's Cloud Firestore as a way to teach people how to build a real-world app using the two technologies. Follow along with our tutorial, [Building a Real-World Web App With Vue.js and Firebase](http://savvyapps.com/blog/definitive-guide-building-web-app-vuejs-firebase), to learn core Vue.js concepts and build this project.

### Project Overview

> In building this project, you'll learn how to:

* Start a production-ready project using Vue CLI.
* Handle and manage state for your app using Vuex. You'll also understand why a central store is important for building large-scale apps.
* Maintain reactivity within your app by utilizing built-in Vuex features.
* Authenticate routes with vue-router.
* Read/write to a database using Firebase's Cloud Firestore.
* Set up authentication using Firebase.
* Leverage components, one of the more powerful features of Vue.js.
* Familiarize yourself with core Vue.js concepts.
